## To get more manageable matrices, we can cut down the dataset:

sleepstudy <- sleepstudy[sleepstudy$Days==0:3 & sleepstudy$Subject %in% c(351, 369, 371), ]

fm1<-lmer(Reaction~Days+(Days|Subject), sleepstudy)
fm1


coefficients(fm1)
# $Subject There are 18 subjects, each with its intercept and slope.


# The average of the intercept and slopes of the different subjects COINCIDES with:

mean(coefficients(fm1)$Subject[,1])
#[1] 251.4051
mean(coefficients(fm1)$Subject[,2])
#[1] 10.46729


# Notice that in the summary we get the SD of both the intercept and slope, because we don't care about what their specific
# values are.

# The calculations of the SD's are close but not quite:

sd(coefficients(fm1)$Subject[,1])
#[1] 21.59594
sd(coefficients(fm1)$Subject[,2])
#[1] 5.455217

#... the same as the values for the sd produced by lmer.

# So let's look at the random effects as they are understood: THE VARIABILITY in the two parameters: intercept and slope:

ranef(fm1)

# And here is the proof that they are assumed to come from a Normal with mean zero:

mean(ranef(fm1)$Subject[,1])
#[1] 5.64995e-13
mean(ranef(fm1)$Subject[,2])
#[1] 9.448618e-14

# Doing a SD of these random effects is not going to coincide with the output, although it will be approximate..

sd(ranef(fm1)$Subject[,1])
#[1] 21.59594
sd(ranef(fm1)$Subject[,2])
#[1] 5.455217
